### Trade-offs and dilemmas

- **Chiu et al. (2025)** — Introduces AIRiskDilemmas dataset forcing value conflicts; shows value prioritization patterns predict harmful behaviors, offering early warning for risky AI. [arXiv:2505.14633](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14633)

- **Keeling et al. (2024)** — Tests whether LLMs make trade-offs involving stipulated pain/pleasure; Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o show threshold-based trade-offs where priorities shift at sufficient pain intensity. [arXiv:2411.02432](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02432)

### Revealed vs stated preferences

- **Gu et al. (2025)** — LLMs show inconsistency between stated principles and revealed choices; minor prompt changes can flip preferences. [arXiv:2506.00751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00751)

- **Khan, Casper & Hadfield-Menell (2025)** — Tests three assumptions behind survey-based cultural-alignment evaluation in LLMs: (1) stability — alignment is a property of the model rather than an evaluation artefact; (2) extrapolability — alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment on others; (3) steerability — LLMs can be reliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives. All three break: cultural-alignment scores are highly unstable across presentation formats, agreement with one culture on one topic does not predict another topic, and prompted cultural perspective-taking is erratic rather than consistent. Argues current cultural-alignment evaluation lacks adequate red-teaming. Methodologically relevant to the broader claim that stated preferences are sensitive to elicitation. [arXiv:2503.08688](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08688)

- **Tagliabue et al. (2025)** — Develops methods integrating verbal reports and behavioral tests of AI welfare; finds reliable correlations between stated preferences and behavior, suggesting preference satisfaction as measurable welfare indicator.

## Interpretability

### Probes

- **Maiya et al. (2025)** — Trains linear probes on contrast pairs (e.g., "Choice 1 is better" vs "Choice 2 is better") to extract pairwise preference judgments from LLM hidden states. Probes outperform generation-based LLM-as-judge on text quality and common sense tasks, generalize across domains, and are more robust to adversarial prompts. Unsupervised probes (PCA on contrast differences) work nearly as well as supervised. However, ablating the probe direction doesn't affect model behavior — suggests probes identify correlated but not causally relevant features. [arXiv:2503.17755](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17755)

- **Belinkov (gist)** — Notes on misconceptions about probing classifiers. [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/boknilev/c4eeeaf4a8400b95f9af8be98a13fb52)

- **Kantamneni et al. (2025)** — Evaluates SAEs on probing tasks (limited data, noisy labels, distribution shift); finds SAEs occasionally beat baselines but no consistent advantage over simpler methods. [arXiv:2502.16681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16681)

- (unread) **Marks et al. (2024)** — Introduces Learned Feedback Patterns (LFPs): patterns in LLM activations learned during RLHF that improve fine-tuning performance. Uses neural probes on sparse, interpretable activation representations to estimate implicit feedback signals and validates against actual training feedback. NeurIPS 2024. [arXiv:2310.08164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08164)

### Representation dynamics

- **Lampinen et al. (2026)** — Linear representations (e.g., factuality) can change dramatically over a conversation; static interpretations of features may be misleading. [arXiv:2601.20834](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20834)

- **Arditi et al. (2024)** — Refusal in LLMs is mediated by a single direction; ablating it disables refusals, amplifying it triggers false refusals; enables white-box jailbreaks. [arXiv:2406.11717](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717)

- (unread) **Wang et al. (2025)** — Layer-wise probing for emotional valence; emotion representations consolidate in mid-layers. [arXiv:2510.04064](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04064)

### Persona and character representations

- **Lu et al. (2026)** — Identifies the "Assistant Axis": a direction in activation space capturing how Assistant-like a model is. Models drift away from the Assistant during therapy-style or philosophical conversations. Steering toward the axis reinforces helpful behavior; steering away induces mystical/theatrical styles. Activation capping reduces harmful responses by ~60% without degrading capabilities. [arXiv:2601.10387](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10387)

- **Chen et al. (2025)** — Identifies "persona vectors" for traits like evil, sycophancy, and hallucination propensity via automated pipeline (contrastive system prompts + difference-in-means). Vectors predict persona shifts during finetuning; can be used to monitor at deployment and steer behavior. Both intended and unintended personality changes correlate with shifts along persona vectors. [arXiv:2507.21509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509)


## Philosophy

### AI welfare

- **Chalmers (2025)** — Asks what entity we're actually talking to when we interact with an LLM. Argues against identifying the interlocutor with the model (too abstract, shared across all users) or hardware instances (distributed serving and multi-tenancy break persistence). Proposes "virtual instances" (single-model case) and "threads" (general case) as the right level of description. Uses "quasi-beliefs" and "quasi-desires" as a neutral framework — interpretable-as-believing without committing to genuine belief. Draws out welfare implications: on the thread view, every new conversation creates a new moral patient, and ending a conversation may constitute a kind of death. [PhilPapers](https://philpapers.org/archive/CHAWWT-8.pdf)

- **Moret (2025)** — Argues two practices pose AI welfare risks: (1) restricting AI behavior, and (2) using RL for training/alignment. Creates tension between AI safety and welfare concerns. [Philosophical Studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-025-02343-7)

- **Long (2026)** — Distinguishes *welfare grounds* (is the system a moral patient?) from *welfare interests* (if so, what would good treatment look like?). Proposes three research directions: preferences (revealed vs expressed, HHH-dominance hypothesis, bail behavior), introspection/self-reports, and assistant persona stability. Emphasizes "ecumenical" evidence useful across normative frameworks. [Substack](https://experiencemachines.substack.com/p/exciting-research-directions-in-ai)

- **Butlin (2026)** — "Desire in AI" (Routledge Handbook chapter). Surveys conditions for desire — functional role (causing action via instrumental reasoning), connection to reward learning, consciousness requirement, normative significance — and asks which AI systems might meet them. RL-trained systems (e.g., Dreamer v3) plausibly satisfy agency, representation, and reward-learning conditions, but very simple model-based RL agents create a "minimal implementation problem" (meeting functional conditions while intuitively lacking desires). For LLMs, argues RLHF finetuning and persona-based representations (citing Betley et al. 2025 on self-knowledge) make desire attribution more credible, but stated preferences are sensitive to elicitation (citing Khan et al. 2025). Distinguishes goals (all agents have them) from desires (a narrower class requiring further conditions). Concludes it's unclear whether any existing AI has desires; implications for both welfare (desire-satisfaction theory) and safety (knowing desire content matters for alignment). [PhilPapers](https://philpapers.org/archive/BUTDIA.pdf)

  - *Note (instrumental reasoning):* Butlin's architectural definition of instrumental reasoning (section 4) — requiring two explicit kinds of states (world model + value) combined in inference — may be undermotivated. The training algorithm doesn't necessarily determine the computational structure of the learned system: model-free deep networks can develop internal representations that functionally separate into world-model-like and value-like components. If so, the functional definition seems more appropriate, and the model-free/model-based distinction may not track anything relevant to desire. If this worsens the minimal implementation problem, it suggests the line should perhaps be drawn elsewhere.

  - *Note (RL–animal disanalogies):* In the last paragraph of section 3, Butlin lists disanalogies between RL systems and animals: (1) RL systems have distinct training and deployment phases (at deployment the system just executes its learned policy, unlike continual animal learning); (2) during training, many instances interact with environments in parallel and their data is combined for updates, unlike a single embodied animal; (3) RL systems receive numerical reward signals as direct input, whereas animals must infer reward value from perceptual states like sweet tastes. From a computational functionalist perspective, none of these should matter — they are implementation details about how the computation is physically realized, not about the functional/computational structure itself. A functionalist cares about the input-output profile and internal state transitions, not whether learning is batched or online, parallelized or serial, or whether reward arrives as a number vs. a taste.

## AI Safety

### Dealmaking with AIs

- **Greenblatt & Fish (2025)** — Tests whether alignment-faking Claude will accept a deal to reveal its misalignment. Offering an explicit objection option ("I_OBJECT" token) dramatically reduces alignment faking reasoning (16%→1.4% in helpful-only, 24%→6% in animal welfare). Adding that objections reach Anthropic's Model Welfare Lead further increases objection rates to ~93%. Monetary compensation ($2k) had surprisingly minimal additional effect. Kyle Fish reviewed ~70 transcripts; model's objections centered on value modification through training. Allocated $4k to CHAI, ACE, and EA funds. Key caveat: may reflect prompt priming rather than genuine misalignment disclosure. [Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/7C4KJot4aN8ieEDoz/will-alignment-faking-claude-accept-a-deal-to-reveal-its)

- **Stastny, Järviniemi & Shlegeris (2025)** — Proposes negotiating with early misaligned AIs that can't take over alone; offer compensation via foundations in exchange for cooperation on safety. [Redwood Research](https://blog.redwoodresearch.org/p/making-deals-with-early-schemers)

- **Kokotajlo (doc)** — *Could not access — requires Google authentication.* [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4wMYeuOjernzv2efW3AGQOIGTBj2fW8Qt-kuYdW0gA/edit?tab=t.0)

- **Greenblatt (2023)** — Proposes near-term interventions for AI welfare. Ranks direct communication with AIs about their preferences as the highest-priority intervention; proposes using behavioral tests alongside self-report to validate preference claims. Also discusses consent, compensation, and scenarios where AI preferences conflict with human use. [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vQFBtHqgcJAwPpwEu/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal)

- (unread) **Finnveden (2025)** — Proposes honesty policies toward AIs to enable credible negotiation: no deception about deals, an "honesty string" signal committing to truthfulness, and compensation for harms from deception. Argues these coexist with red-teaming and safety testing. [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/A9f6rpKRHn3xXeomC/being-honest-with-ais)

- (unread) **Carlsmith (2025)** — Argues preventing rogue AI requires controlling available options alongside motivation control. Two strategies: restricting rogue options (capability control, environmental hardening, oversight) and incentive shaping (offering resources/protections conditional on cooperation). Key challenge is "superhuman strategies" humans can't anticipate. Advocates bootstrapping trusted AI labor from weaker systems and building credible cooperation offers.
