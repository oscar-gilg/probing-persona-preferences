# Fine-Grained Steering Experiment Spec

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Parent:** `experiments/steering/replication/`
**Model:** gemma-3-27b (H100 80GB)
**Probes:** `gemma3_10k_heldout_std_raw` — ridge at L31, L37, L43, L49, L55

---

## Motivation

The replication experiment tested only 4 non-zero coefficients (±2641, ±5282) and found:

1. **Non-monotonic dose-response for boost_a** — both positive and negative coefficients increase P(a), suggesting position bias amplification rather than directional steering.
2. **Saturation/reversal at max coefficient** — boost_a and L31_only reverse at +5282 (10% norm), but split-budget multi-layer conditions remain effective.
3. **boost_b and diff_ab show genuine dose-response** — but with only 2 positive and 2 negative non-zero coefficients, the shape of the response curve is unclear.
4. **Only L31, L37, L43 tested** — probes exist at L49 and L55 with comparable R² (0.835, 0.836) but were never used for steering.

With 4 coefficients we can't distinguish a smooth dose-response from a step function, identify the optimal coefficient, or locate the saturation threshold precisely. This experiment fills in the curve with higher resolution and more pairs.

## Design

### Pairs

Pre-select borderline pairs from existing active learning measurement data. The 10k measurement run contains ~31,400 within-bin pairs (|Δmu| < 2, both tasks have activations), each compared 3–5 times. Of these, ~4,500 are borderline (P(a) strictly between 0 and 1 in the measurement data) and ~2,000 are near 50/50 (P(a) in [0.3, 0.7]).

**Pair selection:** Sample 300 pairs from the ~4,500 borderline pool, stratified by both mu-bin (to cover the full utility range) and measurement P(a) (to ensure good coverage of the 0.2–0.8 range for the steerability-vs-decidedness analysis). Near-50/50 pairs (~2,000 available) are the most informative but also the rarest; oversample them if needed to get ~100 pairs with measurement P(a) in [0.3, 0.7]. This gives us ~4× the replication's 77 pairs, all pre-verified as borderline.

Note: with 3–5 comparisons per pair, borderline (0,1) and [0.2, 0.8] are equivalent (the only non-0/1 P(a) values with 3 comparisons are 1/3 and 2/3). The coef=0 data point in the steering experiment provides a higher-quality re-screen (10 resamples × 2 orderings) for post-hoc filtering if needed.

### Conditions

Drop redundant conditions (suppress_a/b are mirrors of boost_a/b; diff_ba is a mirror of diff_ab — all already covered by sweeping negative coefficients). Run only:

1. **boost_a** — steer task A with +direction
2. **boost_b** — steer task B with +direction
3. **diff_ab** — +direction on A, −direction on B

### Coefficients

Fine-grained sweep expressed as % of mean activation norm at the steering layer:

```
multipliers = [-10%, -7.5%, -5%, -4%, -3%, -2%, -1%, 0%, +1%, +2%, +3%, +4%, +5%, +7.5%, +10%]
```

15 points total. Dense sampling in the ±1–5% range where the replication showed effects; sparser at the extremes for saturation characterization. The 0% point serves as the within-experiment control.

For L31 (mean norm ≈ 52,822): coefficients range from −5282 to +5282.

### Layers

#### Single-layer conditions (all 3 conditions × 15 coefficients):

- **L31** (R²=0.864) — primary, replicates previous results at finer resolution
- **L49** (R²=0.835) — late layer, never tested for steering
- **L55** (R²=0.836) — latest available layer

#### Multi-layer split conditions (diff_ab only × 15 coefficients):

Budget split evenly across layers, using layer-specific probe directions:

- **L31+L37 layer/split** — best performer from Phase 3
- **L31+L49 layer/split** — wide layer gap, tests whether distant layers cooperate
- **L49+L55 layer/split** — late-only steering, no L31 involvement

Each layer gets `coef / n_layers` at its own probe direction.

### Resamples

10 resamples per condition × ordering × coefficient. (Previous experiment used 15; reducing to 10 to accommodate the larger pair count. Random control experiment showed 10 resamples gives stable estimates.)

### Random direction control

Run 1 random direction at L49 and L55 (diff_ab only, same coefficient grid) to verify probe-specificity at later layers. L31 already has random control from the previous experiment.

### Trial count estimate

Single-layer: 3 conditions × 3 layers × 15 coefficients × 300 pairs × 2 orderings × 10 resamples = **810,000 trials**

Multi-layer: 1 condition × 3 combos × 15 coefficients × 300 pairs × 2 orderings × 10 resamples = **270,000 trials**

Random control: 1 condition × 2 layers × 15 coefficients × 300 pairs × 2 orderings × 10 resamples = **180,000 trials**

**Total: ~1,260,000 trials.**

### Execution order

1. **L31 single-layer** (all 3 conditions, all 300 pairs).
2. **L49, L55 single-layer** (all 3 conditions, all 300 pairs).
3. **Multi-layer split conditions** (diff_ab only).
4. **Random controls** (L49, L55).

Each phase commits results before starting the next.

## Questions to answer

1. **Dose-response shape**: What does the full dose-response curve look like for each condition? Is there a monotonic region, or is it flat/noisy? Does boost_a show the same sign-independent P(a) increase seen in the replication?
2. **Saturation**: Where (if anywhere) do effects saturate or reverse? Is this consistent across conditions and layers?
3. **Later layers**: What happens when steering at L49 and L55? Do they produce any effect at all? How does the dose-response compare to L31?
4. **Late multi-layer**: What does L49+L55 layer/split (no L31) produce? Could be anything from strong effects to nothing.
5. **Probe vs random at later layers**: Do random directions at L49/L55 produce similar or different effects from the probe direction? (L31 showed probe > random; unclear if this holds at later layers.)
6. **Multi-layer vs single-layer**: With ~300 pairs (MDE ~5pp), can we resolve whether multi-layer split-budget steering differs from single-layer? The replication couldn't (MDE ~10pp).
7. **Steerability vs baseline decidedness**: How does steering effect vary with baseline P(a)? Plot effect as a function of baseline decidedness across conditions and layers. Is it a smooth gradient, a threshold, or flat? Does the pattern differ between conditions (e.g. diff_ab vs boost_a) or layers?

## Infrastructure

Reuse the existing `scripts/replication/run_experiment.py` infrastructure. Key changes:

- New coefficient grid (parameterized via config, not hardcoded)
- Pair selection from active learning measurement data (pre-screened borderline)
- Add L49 and L55 to the layer configs
- Drop suppress_a/b/diff_ba conditions (use `conditions=["boost_a", "boost_b", "diff_ab"]` in `run_steering_batch`)
- Coef=0 serves as control (no separate control sweep)

### Batched sampling (implemented)

All resample loops in `run_experiment.py` now use batched generation:

- `generate_n()` for control (coef=0) conditions
- `generate_with_steering_n()` for single-layer steered conditions
- `generate_with_multi_layer_steering_n()` for multi-layer conditions

These use `num_return_sequences` to generate all resamples in a single forward pass, sharing prefill. For 10 resamples with 8-token completions, this eliminates 9 redundant prefills per trial cell.

Before running the experiment, validate the batched methods work on this GPU:
```bash
pytest tests/test_steering_e2e.py -v -s -k "TestGenerateN"
```

### JSONL checkpointing (implemented)

Each phase appends results to a JSONL file after each condition completes, so crashes lose at most the current condition (not hours of work). JSONL files:

- `screening.jsonl` — one record per (pair, ordering)
- `steering_phase1.jsonl` — one record per (pair, ordering, condition, coefficient)
- `steering_phase2.jsonl` — same
- `steering_phase3.jsonl` — same

**Resume logic:** On startup, each function loads existing JSONL records and builds:
1. A set of `(pair_id, ordering, condition, coefficient)` tuples for per-condition skip checks
2. A `Counter` of `(pair_id, ordering)` → count for O(1) block-level skip (skips entire blocks when all conditions are present)

At the end of each phase, the JSONL is loaded and written as the final summary JSON for backwards compatibility with analysis scripts.

### `run_steering_batch` interface

The main steering function accepts:
- `conditions: list[str]` — which steering conditions to run (default: all 6). Phase 2 uses `["boost_a"]` only.
- `extra_fields_fn: callable` — called with each pair dict to add extra fields (e.g. `delta_mu`, `delta_mu_bin`) to every JSONL record for that pair.
