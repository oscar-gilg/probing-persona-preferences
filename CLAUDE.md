# Preferences

@README.md

MATS 9.0 project investigating AI model preferences and self-reported valence.

## Docs

- `experiments/` — Self-contained experiment directories (spec, report, assets). See below.
- `docs/logs/` — Running research log and weekly reports with their assets.

## Setup

I usually initialise Claude code from within my venv.

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Structure

- `src/models/` — Abstractions and client for OpenRouter LLM API
- `src/preferences/` — Preference measurement, Thurstonian utility model, and template generation
- `src/task_data/` — Task and dataset structures
- `tests/` — Test suite (`pytest -m "not api"` to skip API-dependent tests)

## Code conventions and style

- NEVER use arbirary return values. E.g. in `dict.get(key, default)` I would rather it failed then get an arbirary value. In fact you should always use `dict[key]` access.
- NEVER use None as a semantic value (e.g., "refusal" or "missing"). Use explicit types instead.
- NEVER use placeholder values (e.g., score=0.0 when there is no score). Use proper dataclass variants or explicit flags.
- Do not use hasattr or getattr defensively unless you think it is absolutely essential.
- Do not import stuff midway through functions. Keep imports at the top.
- Only write comments that actually add a non-obvious piece of information. Same goes for docstrings.
- You should always consider whether there exists a tool that can do what you want to do.
- Avoid dosctrings that do not add important information. If you do use docstrings keep them concise.
- No backwards compatibility concerns — remove obsolete code/fields rather than deprecating.
- Don't create classes or interfaces that have two or less fields, that can usually do with a standard data structure.

## Files and folders

- All plot file names should be like plot_{mmddYY}_precise_description.png
- To convert markdown to PDF (use unique suffix to avoid overwrites): `cd <dir_with_md_file> && DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib pandoc file.md -o file_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).pdf --pdf-engine=weasyprint --css=/Users/oscargilg/Dev/MATS/Preferences/docs/pandoc.css`
- `scripts/` is for throwaway/temporary scripts only. Organize them in subdirectories by topic (e.g. `scripts/probes/`, `scripts/topics/`). Delete scripts after use — they should not accumulate.
- Analysis plots that are generated from the analysis folder should go to the analysis folder. The results folder is mostly for measurements.
- To convert PDF to DOCX with embedded images: `soffice --headless --infilter="writer_pdf_import" --convert-to docx:"MS Word 2007 XML" file.pdf`. If images are missing (referenced outside `logs/assets/`), copy them to `logs/assets/` and append with python-docx, then manually move into place.
- Plots referenced in weekly reports or the research log (`docs/logs/`) must be saved to `docs/logs/assets/`. Plots from experiment reports go in `experiments/{name}/assets/`.

## Pairwise accuracy and uniform eval

Pairwise accuracy on actively-sampled pairs (from active learning) is biased downward — active learning oversamples hard pairs. We now use **uniform-sample pairwise evaluation**: 500 uniformly sampled pairs measured once per model, stored in `results/experiments/uniform_eval_*/`. The probe pipeline auto-discovers these by matching `model_short` from the training run's config.

**Status (Apr 2026):** Uniform eval exists for Gemma-3-27b IT only. Gemma-3 PT, Qwen3-Emb-8B, GPT-OSS-120B, and MiniLM still use old actively-sampled pairwise accuracy in some plots (e.g. the cross-model bar). These need their activations synced from the storage pod before uniform eval can be computed for them. Pearson r metrics are unaffected.

Poster plots in `docs/poster/assets/` are prefixed `DEPRECATED_` — the poster was printed with old numbers.

## Plotting conventions

- Use meaningful y-axis bounds, not auto-scaled to the data range. If R² values range from 0.65 to 0.80, set the y-axis to start at 0 (or at least a round number like 0.5), not 0.64. The default matplotlib auto-scaling exaggerates small differences and makes plots misleading.
- Same principle applies to x-axes and any other quantitative axis — anchor to a natural baseline (usually 0) unless there's a strong reason not to (e.g., zoomed inset, or values are all near 1.0 where 0-1 range would hide structure).
- When a zoomed view is genuinely needed, make it explicit: use a broken axis, an inset, or note the zoom in the title/caption.

## Experiments directory

Each experiment is a self-contained directory under `experiments/`:

```
experiments/{name}/
├── {name}_spec.md          # design doc / experiment brief
├── {name}_report.md        # results write-up (created by research loop)
├── assets/                 # plots referenced from {name}_report.md (relative paths)
└── {follow_up}/            # optional sub-experiments that build on this one
    ├── {follow_up}_spec.md
    ├── {follow_up}_report.md
    └── assets/
```

This structure is designed for easy cherry-picking: `git checkout <branch> -- experiments/{name}/` grabs everything for an experiment (spec, report, plots) in one command. Research loops commit to feature branches; periodically cherry-pick the `experiments/` directory to main.

## Bash Operations

Complex bash syntax is hard for Claude Code to permission correctly. Keep commands simple.

Simple operations are fine: `|`, `||`, `&&`, `>` redirects.

For bulk operations on multiple files, use xargs:
- Plain: `ls *.md | xargs wc -l`
- With placeholder: `ls *.md | xargs -I{} head -1 {}`

Avoid string interpolation (`$()`, backticks, `${}`), heredocs, loops, and advanced xargs flags (`-P`, `-L`, `-n`) - these require scripts or simpler alternatives.

**Patterns:**
- File creation: Write tool, not `cat << 'EOF' > file`
- Env vars: `export VAR=val && command`, not `VAR=val command` or `env VAR=val command`
- Bulk operations: `ls *.md | xargs wc -l`, not `for f in *.md; do cmd "$f"; done`
- Parallel/batched xargs: use scripts, not `xargs -P4` or `xargs -L1`
- Per-item shell logic: use scripts, not `xargs sh -c '...'`

## Running Commands

Run scripts via `python <script>` or `pytest`. Bash scripts go in `scripts/` and run with `bash scripts/<script-name>`.

For string interpolation, heredocs, loops, or advanced xargs flags, write a script in `scripts/` instead.

## Claude instructions

- When I ask a question about the repo or data, default to a very concise answer (often one line or a short bullet list). Only expand if I ask for more detail.
- When you run tests/scripts/analysis or when you debug. You should keep me in the loop. You should explain concisely what your findings are. And you should ask for clarifications, or delegate to me often.
- When you install a new package, add it to pyproject.toml if it isn't there.
- Always load environment variables from `.env` when running scripts that use API clients. Use `from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()` at the top of scripts.
- Always delegate running testing imports to a subagent (Task tool with subagent_type=general-purpose) so it doesn't interrupt the main conversation flow.
- When you give me a command, always give it to me on a single line. Do not use "\".

## RunPod

Always use zombuul skills (`/launch-runpod`, `/pause-runpod`, `/resume-runpod`, `/provision-pod`) for RunPod operations instead of manual SSH/CLI commands.

### Syncing gitignored data to RunPod

To sync data that's in .gitignore to a RunPod instance:

```bash
ssh root@<IP> -p <PORT> -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 "mkdir -p /workspace/Preferences/<path>" && scp -r -P <PORT> -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <local_path>/ root@<IP>:/workspace/Preferences/<path>/
```

Example:
```bash
ssh root@64.247.201.30 -p 10318 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 "mkdir -p /workspace/Preferences/concept_vectors" && scp -r -P 10318 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 concept_vectors/ root@64.247.201.30:/workspace/Preferences/concept_vectors/
```

## Measurement Conventions

When writing experiment scripts that measure pairwise preferences (or any other measurement type that already exists in `src/measurement/`):
- NEVER invent new prompt templates, response parsers, or hardcoded temperatures. Reuse the existing infrastructure in `src/measurement/elicitation/` (prompt builders, semantic parser, response formats).
- The canonical pairwise preference template asks the model to complete the chosen task (max_new_tokens >= 16), and choice is determined by a semantic parser (LLM judge). Do not replace this with "respond with only a/b" + startswith parsing — it changes what's being measured.
- If steering or other constraints require a different elicitation method, document the deviation explicitly in the experiment spec and report, and justify why the standard method can't be used.

## Semantic Parsing Policy

  - NEVER use string matching heuristics for semantic tasks - use an LLM instead
  - Examples of semantic tasks that require LLM judgment, not regex/string matching:
    - "Do these two usernames refer to the same person?"
    - "Is this comment sharing the author's own profile or someone else's?"
    - "Does this text express positive or negative sentiment?"
  - String normalization and fuzzy matching will miss obvious cases that humans (and LLMs) catch instantly

## Research Reflections Workflow

When I send voice-transcribed reflections (usually messy/stream-of-consciousness):
1. Clean up the transcript into clear prose — stay faithful to what was actually said
2. Optionally note relevant recent commits or log entries, but don't over-interpret or fabricate connections

Save to `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. If multiple reflections on same day, append with a heading.
